## Azure Service Bus and Azure Web Jobs with Wil Isaacs

<p>Azure Web jobs and Azure Service bus - This talk will cover how to create web jobs, both scheduled jobs or jobs that are triggered by an Azure service bus message. We will go over how to consume these messages, and a brief overview on service bus topics and subscriptions. This should offer a viable alternative to windows services or console apps that are critical to keeping data up to date.</p> <p><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/wvisaacs">Wil Isaacs</a> has been a software developer for almost 10 years, working mostly in .NET shops.  He enjoys automation and dev ops, and learning about new Azure options. </p> <p><br/>This meetup will be streamed on the official <a href="https://twitch.tv/techlahoma">Techlahoma Twitch Channel</a>!</p> <p><br/>If you would like to give a talk at a future meetup, contact the group organizers through Meetup, email (<a href="mailto:organizers@okcsharp.net">organizers@okcsharp.net</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/okcsharp">Twitter</a>, or the <a href="http://www.techlahoma.org/spaces">Techlahoma Slack</a>. </p> <p>StarSpace46 parking map:</p> <p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57422f09ab48dec01e5e20c7/t/588fb33ee3df2828e8ceb5ab/1485814862865/ss46parking" class="linkified">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57422f09ab48dec01e5e20c7/t/588fb33ee3df2828e8ceb5ab/1485814862865/ss46parking</a></p>
