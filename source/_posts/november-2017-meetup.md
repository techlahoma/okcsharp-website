## The new .NET - .NET on Mac with Docker

<p>In this talk, we introduce a modern .NET. Some of the questions we'll explore:</p> <p>• Can I really run .NET apps on a Mac?</p> <p>• How do I develop for a Mac?</p> <p>• What is Docker?</p> <p>• What are containers?</p> <p>• How do I deploy my fancy new .NET code?</p> <p>• And, Do you secretly work for the Apple store?</p> <p>We'll explore building and running .NET apps in Mac OS. We'll learn to build applications as a Docker container. Finally we'll deploy these apps to Azure, and see them in the wild, all from the super uncomfortable world of Apple.</p> <p>Danny is Director of Engineering at Monscierge and totally doesn't work at the Apple Store. He enjoys all things software and loves to chat tech, gaming, and food.</p>
