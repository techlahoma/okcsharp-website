## Game of Services - Anemia is Coming

<p>Service-Oriented Programming is built on top of Object-Oriented Programming principles, but SOP is not OOP. Service-Oriented Programming is the root of Internet of Things, MicroServices, and other Service-Oriented Architectures. SOP, and its designs, have long been considered Anti-Patterns to OOP. Luckily for us, Service-Oriented Programming has its own principles, and doesn't have to follow the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Learn the roots of SOP, Master its basics, and see SOP through the eyes of a large systems practitioner.</p> <p>Suamere (Steven Fletcher):</p> <p>My interest in computers began around the release of Wolfenstein, DooM, Hexen, and Duke Nukem. I immediately jumped into level design and learning to network with my buddies so we could PVP. My first programming was around 1994 when I was programming fan sites for DooM and Legend of Zelda. I built many sites for family businesses, personal usage, and even my High School between 1994 and 2000. My main hobbies included C#, C++, HTML, and javascript. I did classic asp/vb "dynamic database-driven websites" from '98-'05 for both gamer groups and the US Navy. My language experience, in descending order, is in C#, then Javascript, then Java, then C++, and others I have dabbled in. I like to mod games like WoW and Skyrim, or build Android apps on my spare time. My favorite food is bread and my favorite color is gray. Also, I'm not at all boring.</p>
